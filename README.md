# Minimal Raspberry Pi 3 Linux configuration and Buildroot image to support headunit-desktop

Project based on https://github.com/romainreignier/minimal_raspberrypi_buildroot

Objectives:
- be fast to boot
- build stable image ready to flash that supports all functionality needed by headunit-desktop
- with wifi and bluetooth support
- automatically starts headunit-desktop

Nice to have:
- read-only partition to minimize issues with sudden power loss
